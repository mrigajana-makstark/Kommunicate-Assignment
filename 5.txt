If I am to start a software company, 2 people from my batch whom I will choose as my partners are Ditipriya Ganguly and Pradeep Yellapu. I have worked with them in various projects. This trio is best suited as me being a Graphics designer and front-end developer can work thorough with those and on the other hand Pradeep is an UI/UX developer so my graphics skills and Pradeep's UI/UX helps us to build an efficient and attractive front end. As they say face is the reflection of mind. On the other hand Ditipriya  is one of the content writer and backend developer in the team. Along with generous content and updated and smooth backend helps one to have a smooth user experience. Along with that I have some ideas in social media marketting and Ditipriya some experiance in Public relations along with Pradeep who is good in management skills. All three of us has enough amount of skills to back each other up. Being in a team means to help each other to grow and work in sync. Also, i feel its good to have a professional and cordial relationship with a fellow business partner or entrepreneur as it helps one to take unbiased, wise and fruitful decision without any emotional baggage. Hence, with both of them i share a not so friendly but just a professional bond. So if I am to start a company this is the team I choose.
